In pursuance of the recommendations of the said Commission and the deliberations made in the \ntripartite meeting comprising of the Government, employers' and industry representatives, it has been \ndecided to bring the proposed legislation. The proposed legislation intends to amalgamate, simplify and \nrationalise the relevant provisions of the following four central labour enactments relating to wages, \nnamely:— \n(a) the Payment of Wages Act, 1936;  \n(b) the Minimum Wages Act, 1948; \n(c) the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965; and",

The amalgamation of the said laws will facilitate the implementation and also remove the \nmultiplicity of definitions and authorities without compromising on the basic concepts of welfare and \nbenefits to workers. The proposed legislation would bring the use of technology in its enforcement. All \nthese measures would bring transparency and accountability which would lead to more effective \nenforcement. Widening the scope of minimum wages to all workers would be a big step for equity. The \nfacilitation for ea se of compliance of labour laws will promote in setting up of more enterprises thus \ncatalyzing the creation of employment opportunities. \n 4.
